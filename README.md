## Abstract
Our understanding of how changing climates and anthropogenic influence alter population trajectories are largely based on models of life-history and ecological dynamics. However, artificial drivers for smaller body size through climate warming and over-harvesting have also caused marine organism size to decline. Here we test how body size influences reproductive-energy output in nesting sea turtles, an ecologically and economically relevant taxa. Through meta-analysis, we looked at variations in reproductive-energy output between species and population, along with presenting empirical evidence of within-population decrease in nesting female body size across a decade of nest monitoring (1993-2019). Our results show different allocation of reproductive output between species, however all species show disproportionate increase in reproductive-energy output with an increasing size. We also show evidence of decreased female body size and mean clutch size within a population of green sea turtles over the last decade. These results provide quantitative evidence for sea turtle management and conservation efforts, as well as the necessity to account for scaling effects of body size in population models.
