## Abstract
Artificial drivers for smaller body size through changing climates and over-harvesting have caused marine organism size to decline over the last century. Since larger females show disproportionally greater energy investment to producing offspring, the selection pressures for smaller body size may decrease population recruitment, especially for large, slow growing megafaunas. Here we examine how body size influences the reproductive-energy output of seven species of nesting female sea turtles, along with fine-scale changes in body size from a population of nesting female *Chelonia mydas* across a decade of nest monitoring (1993â€“2019). Our results show different reproductive output strategies with increasing body size (clutch size and egg volume) between species. However, the total reproductive-energy output for all species (excluding *Lepidochelys olivacea*) was disproportionately greater for larger nesting females. We also found evidence of decreasing female body size and mean clutch size within a population of C. mydas over the last decade. These results provide quantitative evidence for sea turtle management and conservation efforts, as well as the necessity to account for scaling effects of body size in predicting anthropogenically-mediated population shifts.
