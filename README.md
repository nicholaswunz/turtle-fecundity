## Abstract
Aim: Body size of marine megafauna can influence population dynamics because larger females have disproportionally greater reproductive output. We explored how this size scaling relationship can affect predictions of population-size structure in nesting sea turtles by combining a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis with a long-term field nesting survey.  
Location: Global (meta-analysis), and Malaysia (field survey).  
Time period: Present.  
Major taxa studied: Sea turtles.  
Methods: We extracted body size and reproductive parameters of all sea turtle species from the literature and estimated the reproductive-energy output using allometric models. We then examined the relationship between body size and the proportion of protected nesting beaches by country as an indicator of conservation efforts on body size. Long-term monitoring (1993â€“2019) of body size and nesting data on green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Redang Island (Malaysia) was used to examine temporal changes in body size and fecundity, and to test whether the size scaling of fecundity was isometric (linear) or allometric (curvilinear).  
Results: We show that the total reproductive-energy output for all sea turtle species was disproportionately greater for larger nesting females. We also found no strong correlations for countries with higher proportion of protected nesting sites with female size. Finally, we show that accounting for reproductive hyperallometry provided more accurate estimations of yearly reproductive output than assuming an isometric relationship in our green turtle population.  
Main conclusions: Understanding ecosystem function and conservation effort requires accurate predictions of population trends. Our findings highlight the necessity to account for scaling effects of body size in predicting anthropogenically-mediated population shifts, as well as the need to protect large females in order to maximise effective population replenishment.
