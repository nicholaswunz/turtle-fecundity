## Abstract
Artificial drivers for smaller body size through changing climates and over-harvesting have caused many marine species size to decline over the last decade. The selection pressures for smaller size may decrease population recruitment, especially for large, slow-growing megafaunas because typically larger females exhibit disproportionally greater energy investment to producing offspring. Here we examined how body size influence the reproductive-energy output of all species of sea turtles, and the observed trends in nesting female size in multiple sites with different degrees of protection across the globe. After accounting for phylogenetic influence and within-species variation, we show the total reproductive-energy output for all species was disproportionately greater for larger nesting females. We also found that countries with higher proportion of protected nesting sites were important predictors for larger nesting females listed as critically endangered. These results provide quantitative evidence for sea turtle management and conservation efforts, as well as the necessity to account for scaling effects of body size in predicting anthropogenically-mediated population shifts.
